# Introduction 

<!--
Describe the questions of interest: what are they and why are they important or useful to you?
-->

# Data collection 

<!--
Briefly describe your data collection process, including how you defined variables of interest (include the levels/categories of categorical variables and the units for quantitative variables).
--> 


<!--
The code below is provided as a starting point for importing an `ics` file into R as a dataframe, doing some initial wrangling, and adding up the time spent on each activity. You are not required to use this code, but I hope it is useful as you get started. Feel free to delete or modify it as you see fit. 

If you are using the code, be sure to update the capitalized parts with the relevant path to where your `ics` file is located *relative to where this Rmd file is located in the repo*, and set `eval = TRUE`.

NOTE: All of your wrangling should be in this file - preferably well-organized and in one place if possible. You may use multiple chunks if it makes it easier to tell your narrative. This is demo-ed below, where the data is wrangled first for one visualization, then could be used for the second, etc. 
-->

```{r import-wrangle}
# Data import and preliminary wrangling
calendar_data <- "WagamanCalendarQuery.ics" %>% 
  ## Use ical package to import into R
  ical_parse_df() %>% 
  ## Convert to "tibble" data frame format
  as_tibble() %>% 
  ## calendar event descriptions are in a variable called "summary"
  ## "activity" is a more relevant/informative variable name
  rename(activity = summary) %>% 
  mutate(
    ## Specify time zone (defaults to UTC otherwise)
    start_datetime = with_tz(start, tzone = "America/New_York"),
    end_datetime = with_tz(end, tzone = "America/New_York"),
    ## Compute duration of each activity in hours
    duration = interval(start_datetime, end_datetime) / hours(1),
    ## Convert text to lower case and trim spaces to help clean up
    ## potential inconsistencies in formatting
    activity = str_to_lower(activity),
    ## separate date from time
    date = floor_date(start_datetime, unit = "day"),
    ## Examples of ways to parse dates, times
    year = year(date),
    month = month(date, label = FALSE),
    day = day(date),
    day_of_week = wday(date, label = TRUE),
    day_of_year = yday(date)) %>% 
  ## remove spurious year (added to every Google calendar)
  filter(year != 1969)
```

```{r}
# Compute total duration for each activity and number of each
activities_total <- calendar_data %>% 
  group_by(activity) %>%
  summarize(duration = sum(duration),
            count = n())

```

<!--
Briefly describe and justify your plans for analysis (i.e., visualizations and summary table). Which graphs and corresponding visual cues do you plan to use? Which summary measures will you use in your table? (This will likely be a less detailed version of what you submitted for your proposal.) The idea is to let your reader know what is coming before they get to it. 
--> 


# Results 

<!--
You may organize your results however you see fit (e.g., one subsection for each question or one subsection for each visualization/table). 

Each visualization and table should have its own code chunk. 

Before each code chunk, describe what information is conveyed through the corresponding visualization or table in connection with the questions you posed (e.g., "The first figure captures how the time I spent on each class varied over the two-week period. It appears I spent the most time on..."). 
-->


<!--
Describe what information is conveyed through your first data visualization (that you'll create below).
-->


```{r}
ggplot(activities_total, mapping = aes(x = count, y = duration, color = activity))+
  geom_point()+
  labs(x = "Number of Sessions",
       y = "Total Duration",
       title = "Sessions versus Total Time")
```

<!--
Describe what information is conveyed through your second data visualization (that you'll create below).
-->


```{r}
# Code for second data visualization
# Be sure to provide meaningful title and axes labels and
# resize figure appropriately
# Only code for your second visualization should be here (no or very minimal wrangling code)
# Remove all these comments!
```

<!--
Describe what information is conveyed through the table (that you'll create) below. Again, the order is up to you. Move these around so they make sense for your analysis!
-->


```{r, results = 'asis'}
# Code for table
# Only code for your table should be here (no or very minimal wrangling code)
```

# Conclusions 

<!--
With your initial questions in mind, briefly summarize what you learned about how you spent your time. What are the big take-aways for you about how you spend your time? If relevant, how does this affect how you might spend your time going forward?
-->

# Reflection 

<!--
Write your reflection here in paragraph form. In particular, address...

* What difficulties in the data collection and analysis process did you encounter?  Identify two of your main hurdles in gathering accurate data.
* What implications do those difficulties have for future data collection and/or analysis projects if you were to repeat this project? 
* Did you have enough data? How much data do you think you'd need to collect in order to satisfactorily answer your question(s) of interest? Would it be hard to collect that data? Why or why not?
* As someone who provides data, what expectations do you have when you give your data (e.g. to Facebook, Google, MapMyRun, etc.)?  
* As someone who analyzes others' data, what ethical responsibilities do you have?

You may address these questions in any particular order. If it helps, you can make a subsection for each.
